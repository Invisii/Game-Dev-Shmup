# 09.25.20 Started From the Bottom _(Brainstorming)_

When we first brainstormed ideas for a Shmup, we came up with three of them. I really liked the second one I came up with, and I feel like it has a lot of potential to be expanded upon:

> A bullet hell where you are a barista in a cafe and you must bring coffee to people without taking too much damage.

I imagine this as a sort of multidirectional shooter where you are berated by multiple enemies that keep appearing rather than a single boss (though a mechaKaren might be a fun boss battle/elite enemy).

I also imagine the core mechanic as tied to the consistency of your actions almost like a rhythm game mechanic. I imagine this in the form a meter that slowly empties over time but fills in bursts when you suddenly change direction or shoot too rapidly. Going over the limit of the meter causes you to spill some of the drink you are carrying thereby reducing the points from its delivery.

Spilling the drink provides an interesting opportunity for another mechanic: a temporary slippery surface on the floor that might cause you to move erratically if you pass back over it.

I really like this idea especially since it focuses heavily on the avoidance aspect of shmup games. However, given the mechanics I would like to implement, I imagine this will lighter on the bullet hell aspect since the consistency of your movements hold such importance.
